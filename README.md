# Decision Tree Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier, a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. The decision tree algorithm splits the data into subsets based on the most significant feature at each node, creating a tree-like model of decisions.

## Features
- **Easy to use**: Simple interface for training and predicting.
- **Customizable**: Adjustable parameters such as maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf, and splitting criteria.
- **Visualizations**: Tools to visualize the tree structure and decision boundaries.
- **Performance Metrics**: Functions to evaluate the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the model.

## Installation
To use this Decision Tree Classifier, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree-classifier.git
cd decision-tree-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Training the Model
To train the model, you need to provide a dataset and specify the parameters:
```python
from decision_tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Load your dataset
X_train, y_train = load_your_data_function()

# Initialize and train the classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Making Predictions
Once the model is trained, you can make predictions on new data:
```python
# Load your test data
X_test = load_your_test_data_function()

# Predict using the trained model
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
```

### Evaluating the Model
Evaluate the performance of your model using various metrics:
```python
from decision_tree import evaluate_model

# Evaluate and print metrics
evaluate_model(clf, X_test, y_test)
```

### Visualizing the Tree
Visualize the decision tree to understand the model's decisions:
```python
from decision_tree import plot_tree

# Plot the decision tree
plot_tree(clf)
```
